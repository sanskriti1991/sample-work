### Machine Learning Projects - Udacity's Nanodegree program 2018
Compilation of several machine learning projects I worked on while completing Udacity's Nanodegree program. [GitHub](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects)

| Project | Description |
| ------:| :-----------|
| [Boston Housing Prediction](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects/blob/master/bostonHousing/boston_housing.ipynb)   | Evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. |
| [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb) | Best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with and equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. |
| [Finding donors for charity ML](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb)    | Construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 for a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. |


### Web samples (HTML/CSS and JavaScript)
Few html css mockups and Java script functions - 3D rendering library, forms and layouts.  [GitHub](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/web-samples/tree/gh-pages)

| [CSS Customization of template](https://sanskriti1991.github.io/web-samples/Boilerplate/Boilerplate/index1.html)   | Customized css template. |
| [JavaScript Rendering Library](https://sanskriti1991.github.io/web-samples/graphics/CS580HW61.html) | Developed a graphics library, to render 3-D objects. Created in JavaScript, with an aim to render a 3-D object just like real life objects by adding lighting, shading and texture effects. |
| [Basic Java Script Form](https://sanskriti1991.github.io/web-samples/travel_fund_document.html#)    | Basic javascript form to do calculations and dynamically generate rows. |
| [![EbayUI](https://sanskriti1991.github.io/web-samples/eBaySearchTool/ebayUI.png)](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/web-samples/tree/gh-pages/eBaySearchTool) | Jquery validations and bootstrap used to design ebay custom search filter options. |
| [![MockUpBootstrap](https://sanskriti1991.github.io/web-samples/MockUpBootstrap/MWP.png)](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/web-samples/tree/gh-pages/MockUpBootstrap) | Bootstarp and Javascript to design drop downs with icons. |
