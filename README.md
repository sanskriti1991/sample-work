### Machine Learning Projects - Udacity's Nanodegree program 2018
Compilation of several machine learning projects I worked on while completing Udacity's Nanodegree program.
| Project| Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [Boston Housing Prediction](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects/blob/master/bostonHousing/boston_housing.ipynb) | Evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value.|
| [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb) | Best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with and equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. |
| [Finding donors for charity ML](https://github.com/sanskriti1991/machineLearningProjects/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb)    |  Construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 for a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. |

### Web samples (HTML/CSS and JavaScript)
Few html css mockups and Java script functions - 3D rendering library, forms and layouts.  

### Demo reel 
Compilation of several computer animation and gaming projects. I worked on a team/ individual while pursuing MS in computer science at USC (Aug2014- May 2016)
